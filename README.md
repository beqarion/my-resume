## About Me

I'm Bekar Shekiladze, a versatile engineer with a strong foundation in telecommunications and a burgeoning passion for web development. With a background in microware communications engineering and a Cisco CCENT certification, I've honed my skills in the world of wireless technology and networking.

### Telecommunications Journey

For over a decade, I've been an integral part of the telecommunications industry. I've contributed to projects like the "Georgian Government Network" (GGN) and "Irmis nakhtomi," which aimed to connect schools to the internet through advanced microwave technology. Currently, I work at Caucasus Online as a Transmission Engineer, where I monitor, troubleshoot, and maintain the Optical Transmission system.

### Venturing into Web Development

In parallel, I've been exploring the exciting world of web development. I've created web projects like the [Meet Landing Page](https://beqarion.github.io/meet-landing-page/), [Drum Machine](https://beqarion.github.io/DrumMachine/), [Markdown Previewer](https://beqarion.github.io/mark-down-previewer/), and more. These projects showcase my proficiency in technologies like HTML, CSS, React, JavaScript, and more.
